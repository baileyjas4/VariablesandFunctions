How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

The way I approached flexible functions was going back looking into lectures we did earlier the day and just using the resources and using both what I learned in class and also adding what I found on W3 schools. 

Challenges were my functions alone trying to fully understand the vocabulary what does what what makes my function actually function how to return items a little bit of everything definitely will be studying more and practicing more with script
